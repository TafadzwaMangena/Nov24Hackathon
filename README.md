## UX Design


### Accessibility:


### Feedback Mechanism:

- "sent" messages
- Hover and click effects on buttons and links

### Consistency:

The website maintains a consistent design language throughout all screens, using a cohesive color scheme, typography, and layout. This consistency helps users focus on the content and functions without being distracted by changing interfaces.

#### Color scheme

#### Favicon

### Wireframes

- The website layout is highly simple and centralized. Divs with curved edges were chosen to give a lighter mood to the website. Simple design also helps with clarity and navigation. All buttons are accessible with your thumb closer to the bottom of the page, which can be useful for users with large cellphones.
